/** Lets the user draw "stars" - lots of lines from a center - using the mouse.
 * The program has two "modes":
 *   setting the center of the star,
 *   setting the points on the star.
 * When the user clicks the mouse:
 *   If the mode is setting the center, it draws a little circle of size 4 at the
 *     position the mouse was released, and stores the position  as the current center
 *   If the mode is setting the points, it draws a line from the
 *    the current center to the position where the mouse was released 
 *  
 * When the user clicks the "Set Center" button, the program changes the mode to setting center
 *  (Note: clicking the button does not draw anything!)
 * When the user clicks the "Set Points" button, the program changes the mode to setting points
 *  (Note: clicking the button does not draw anything!)
 * The user can click the "Clear" button to clear the graphics window

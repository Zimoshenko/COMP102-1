/** A PartyBalloon object represents a small round balloon on the graphics pane.
 *   It remembers its current position and its color.
 *   Its initial position and its color are set when it is constructed
 *   The diameter of a balloon should be 30.
 *   It has three methods:
 *        draw(),         which draws the balloon at its current position
 *        riseLeft(),  which makes the balloon rise up by 20, and move 5 to the left
 *        riseRight(), which makes the balloon rise up by 20, and move 5 to the right
